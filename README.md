### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The labs definitely helped me with this assignment, since it helped me set up my database application and get me familiar with Postman requests. I felt a bit unprepared with how each data table relates to each other and how to implement those relations.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would definitely update the UI to make it more interesting and unique. In addition, I would also want to deploy the website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I unfortantely did not demo this project, since I had my mentor meeting, but the peers that I saw present had really cool UI that was inspired by other shopping sites along with additional features like an admin page.

### Open-source libraries used
